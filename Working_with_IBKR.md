This guide will be using Interactive Brokers(IBKR) to trade stocks and forex by connecting to the API/Server.
The initial steps include visiting the official Interactive Brokers website and creating a "Paper Trading" account, and then proceeding to install their trader workstation through which we would place trades after API connection
A paper trading account is not the same as a brokerage account. It is used for simulated trading. Real time market data is delayed.
Our goal here is to be able to trade using python and run python algorithms to test out strategies. For this we need to be able to work with python and jupyter notebooks. Downloading Anaconda and installing python and its data science packages is advisable.
